Proper application of cruise control has become more than just a simple luxury. For many vehicle owners, cruise control allows them to save as much as 20% on fuel economy when driving on long-distance road trips. Others rely on cruise control to help relieve pressure on knees, leg muscles, and sore joints. However you use the cruise control on your vehicle, it is a hassle to fix it on your own.

One of the leading components that fails sooner than others is the cruise control brake release switch. The job of the cruise control brake release switch is to allow drivers to deactivate the cruise control by simply tapping the brake pedal. This switch is used on automatic transmission vehicles, while on most vehicles with a manual transmission there is a clutch release switch that cancels the cruise control once the clutch pedal is depressed.

Additionally, there is always a hand-operated button that deactivates the cruise control on the steering wheel or turn signal arm. Having multiple deactivating devices is mandatory for vehicles sold in the United States as it's an important safety feature.

There are several individual components that comprise the cruise control system that may cause the vehicle's cruise control to fail, but we'll assume that the proper diagnosis has determined that the brake switch is faulty and needs to be replaced. There are two common reasons why the brake switch may be faulty, both of which cause the cruise control to malfunction.

The first case is when the cruise control brake switch does not open, which means that when you press on the brake pedal it does not shut off the cruise control. The second case is when the cruise control brake switch does not close the circuit, which does not permit the cruise control to set. In either case, this requires a replacement of the brake pedal cruise control switch.

-Note: The specific location and steps for removing this component may vary based on the vehicle you own. The steps below are general instructions. Make sure to verify specific steps and guidelines with your vehicle manufacturer service manual before proceeding.

-Warning: Working on electrical equipment such as the cruise control brake switch can result in physical harm if you don't disconnect the power supply before attempting to remove any electrical components. If you don't feel 100 percent confident about replacing the cruise control brake switch or don't have the recommended tools or help, please contact an ASE certified mechanic to complete this job for you.
