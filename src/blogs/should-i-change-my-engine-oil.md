Engine oil is the lifeblood of your car’s engine. It is used to lubricate all the internal moving parts and help keep components from overheating. Changing oil is an extremely important part of keeping your engine in good operating condition.

Some cars have a service interval counter which is built into the vehicle’s dashboard, while other cars do not. If your car does not have a built-in system, use reminders, such as those provided by YourMechanic. You can also look at your car manual to see the recommended interval.

Depending on your car and the type of oil in it, it’s typically recommended that you change the oil every 3,000 to 7,000 miles, and replace the oil filter each time. It's good to know the reasons why cars have different oil change intervals, as well as the right type of oil to use in your engine. Some engines need oil better designed to withstand heat, such as Mobil 1 Classic or Mobil 1 Mobil 1 Advanced Full Synthetic Motor Oil.
